# GoodMorningApp (Android Nanodegree graduation project)
The main idea of GoodMorning app is to send reminders, messages, alarms & beautiful happy birthday animations and photos to people close to you. with mainly solved problems of other apps doing the main thing:

1. Wi-Fi, 3G or Blutooth consumption - the app opens one of them o check for updates then it closes the connection to save battery and network consumption.

2. Noise and notifications while sleeping - the app only notify user with the recived message in three cases:
- User's waking up time (is now or passed).
- User waked up and starts using the phone.
- User enables a friend to send him message/alarm at specific time to wake him up.  
And about other apps notification recived when the app opens Wifi/3G to check for updates, the app mutes them temporary. 

3. Having a unique customized celebration of birthday and events that can be synconized with recieving a gift from Amazon for example for people that are in a remote place to you.


Good Morning app is very simple right now that enable users to just send message on custom lock screen.
